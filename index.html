  <h2>What is the VFL?</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>The VRChat Football League (VFL)</strong> is a competitive football
    league created by <strong>MoistIsFallen</strong>, designed to be the most
    accurate and authentic form of VR football on VRChat.
  </p>

  <p>
    The league began with the creation of its first VRChat world on
    <strong>December 22nd, 2025</strong>, laying the foundation for structured,
    strategy-driven gameplay in virtual reality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Shortly after, on <strong>Christmas Day</strong>, the league’s first official
    team was formed —
    <strong>The Bulwark Titans</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the VFL has not yet hosted its first official game, development
    continues every day. With worlds, teams, and systems steadily coming
    together, the league moves closer and closer to kickoff.
